# Overview

This program is a Breadth First Search in wikipedia. Meaning that it is a graph traversial in wikipedia using their own API. 
I chose to learn rust for this because rust has some of the most cost effective abrastractions in any program.
Another reasons I chose rust for this application is that the rust community is very adament that rust is the next C,
that if you learn rust, you will not have to learn another language. Which after learning this I still think it is valuable to be 
efficient at learning languages, and have a repitiour of different languages that you are familiar with. 

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
The reason I wanted to write this program is because I have been intregued with graphs recently and I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL3uWO-KLUE) by PolyLog
where he talked about the more abstract side of graph traversial, and I wanted to see if I could apply this. I felt like this was too difficult, 
that there would be no way in two weeks that I would be able to 1) learn a new language, and 2) implement something I felt was computationally complicated.
However, despite getting worried after spending 5 days just learning the syntax of rust, I was able to implement the rest of the program in only 5 days. Here is my demo/ explaination video.

# Development Environment

This program was developed in vs.code using Rust's Cargo. And Git with vs.code. 

Rust is a highlevel language that is computationally powerful and a syntactical nightmare. 
Learning rust was a difficult task to do, and learning how to use their libraries. Most libraries I used were standard, however I also used _reqwest_ and _tokio_ to implement the Wikipedia API calls.

# Future Work

For me to complete this project and be completely satisfied I want to adjust the API calls in wiki to exclude more links and make sure there are no links that shouldn't be in the graph
